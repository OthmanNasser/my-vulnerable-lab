# my-vulnerable-lab

A custom vulnerable lab setup for penetration testing practice using Kali Linux, Metasploitable2, and common attack tools.

---

## Lab Overview

This is a custom penetration testing lab designed for practicing offensive security skills in a safe local environment.

### Components:
- **Attacker Machine**: Kali Linux (2024.1)
- **Target Machine**: Metasploitable2 (Ubuntu 8.04)
- **Network**: Host-only (VirtualBox)

---

## Objectives

- Enumerate network services using tools like `nmap`, `gobuster`.
- Exploit known vulnerabilities in FTP, HTTP, and SSH.
- Practice privilege escalation techniques.
- Build and document repeatable attack scenarios.

---

## Tools Used

- Kali Linux tools: `nmap`, `hydra`, `sqlmap`, `burpsuite`, `msfconsole`, `gobuster`
- Custom scripts written in `bash` and `python`

## ðŸ“‚ Documented Attacks

Below are the documented attack scenarios performed against the Metasploitable2 machine:

1. [FTP Anonymous Access](attacks/ftp_anonymous_access.md)  
   â†’ Scan FTP port and log in anonymously to explore files.

2. [vsftpd 2.3.4 Backdoor Exploit](attacks/vsftpd_backdoor_exploit.md)  
   â†’ Use Metasploit to exploit a backdoor vulnerability and gain shell access.

3. [Web Directory Enumeration using Gobuster](attacks/web_enum_gobuster.md)  
   â†’ Discover hidden directories and files using wordlist brute force.

> More attacks will be added soon (SQL Injection, Privilege Escalation, Hydra brute-force...).
